1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates .git directory with files, which is necessary for normal work. 
To say git git that I'm going to use this directory for "gitting"

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

With staging area I can commit not all files at once, but only these, 
which is related my change.
